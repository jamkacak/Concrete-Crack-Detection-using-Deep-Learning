# **Concrete Crack Detection using Deep Learning**  

## **Project Overview**  
Cracks in concrete structures can compromise the safety and durability of buildings. This project aims to develop an AI model for classifying concrete images as either **cracked** or **non-cracked** using deep learning techniques. The developed model could help in early detection and prevention of structural failures.  

## **Dataset**  
- The dataset used for training and evaluation is available at:  
  [Mendeley Data - Concrete Crack Images](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5y9wdsg2zt/2)  
- Since the dataset is large, it is **not included** in this repository. Please download it from the link above.  

## **Project Workflow**  
1. **Problem Formulation** - Understanding the impact of concrete cracks and defining the objective of image classification.  
2. **Data Preparation** - Loading, cleaning, augmenting, and splitting data into training and testing sets.  
3. **Model Development** -  
   - Adapted **MobileNetV2** for transfer learning.  
   - Fine-tuned the model on the concrete crack dataset.  
   - Applied techniques to improve performance and generalization.  
4. **Model Training & Evaluation** -  
   - Ensuring accuracy **>90%**.  
   - Used **EarlyStopping** to prevent overfitting.  
   - Visualized training using **TensorBoard**.  
5. **Model Deployment** - Using the trained model included in the model folder to classify new concrete images.

```

## **Installation & Setup**  
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies using:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Training the Model**  
Run the Jupyter notebook:  

- **Without EarlyStopping & TensorBoard**  
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook train.ipynb
  ```
- **With EarlyStopping, TensorBoard & Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2)**  
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook "train copy.ipynb"
  ```

## **Model Architecture**  
- Used **MobileNetV2** as the base model for transfer learning.  
- Fine-tuned specific layers for better feature extraction.  
- Added custom **fully connected layers** for classification.  

## **Model Performance**  
- **Achieved Accuracy:** >90% (target)  
- **Loss & Accuracy plots**: Available in the `images/` folder  
- **Overfitting Prevention:**  
  - `train.ipynb`: No EarlyStopping  
  - `train copy.ipynb`: EarlyStopping + TensorBoard  

## **Model Architecture**
